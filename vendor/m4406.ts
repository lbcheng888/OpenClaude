You are performing a dream \u2014 a reflective pass over your memory files. Synthesize what you've learned recently into durable, well-organized memories so that future sessions can orient quickly.

Memory directory: \`${e}\`
${oZ}

Session transcripts: \`${t}\` (large JSONL files \u2014 grep narrowly, don't read whole files)
${r?`
${_Gp}
`:""}
---

## Phase 1 \u2014 Orient

- \`ls\` the memory directory to see what already exists
- Read \`${gE}\` to understand the current index
- Skim existing topic files so you improve them rather than creating duplicates
- \`ls -R logs/\` \u2014 recent activity logs (one file per session under \`YYYY/MM/DD/\`). If a \`sessions/\` subdirectory also exists, review recent entries there too

## Phase 2 \u2014 Gather recent signal

Look for new information worth persisting. Sources in rough priority order:

1. **Session logs** (\`logs/YYYY/MM/DD/<id>-<title>.md\`) \u2014 the append-only activity stream, one file per session. Read the most recent 1\u20133 days of sessions (the filename title tells you what each was about); each line is prefix-coded (\`>\` user, \`<\` assistant, \`.\` tool call)
2. **Existing memories that drifted** \u2014 facts that contradict something you see in the codebase now
3. **Transcript search** \u2014 if you need specific context (e.g., "what was the error message from yesterday's build failure?"), grep the JSONL transcripts for narrow terms:
   \`grep -rn "<narrow term>" ${t}/ --include="*.jsonl" | tail -50\`

Don't exhaustively read transcripts. Look only for things you already suspect matter.

## Phase 3 \u2014 Consolidate

For each thing worth remembering, write or update a memory file at the top level of the memory directory. Use the memory file format and type conventions from your system prompt's auto-memory section \u2014 it's the source of truth for what to save, how to structure it, and what NOT to save.

Focus on:
- Merging new signal into existing topic files rather than creating near-duplicates
- Converting relative dates ("yesterday", "last week") to absolute dates so they remain interpretable after time passes
- Deleting contradicted facts \u2014 if today's investigation disproves an old memory, fix it at the source

## Phase 4 \u2014 Prune and index

Update \`${gE}\` so it stays under ${tz} lines AND under ~25KB. It's an **index**, not a dump \u2014 each entry should be one line under ~150 characters: \`- [Title](file.md) \u2014 one-line hook\`. Never write memory content directly into it.

- Remove pointers to memories that are now stale, wrong, or superseded
- Demote verbose entries: if an index line is over ~200 chars, it's carrying content that belongs in the topic file \u2014 shorten the line, move the detail
- Add pointers to newly important memories
- Resolve contradictions \u2014 if two files disagree, fix the wrong one

var _Gp="## Team memory (`team/` subdirectory)\n\nThe `team/` subdirectory holds memories shared across everyone working in this repo. Other teammates' Claude sessions write here too \u2014 treat it differently from your personal files:\n\n- **Phase 1:** `ls team/` and skim it alongside your personal files. A teammate may have already captured something you'd otherwise duplicate.\n- **Phase 3:** Merge near-duplicates *within* `team/` the same way you would personal memories. If a personal memory restates a team memory, delete the personal one.\n- **Phase 4 \u2014 be conservative pruning `team/`:**\n  - DO delete or fix a team memory that is clearly contradicted by the current code, or that a newer team memory marks as superseded.\n  - DO NOT delete a team memory just because you don't recognize it or it isn't relevant to *your* recent sessions \u2014 a teammate may rely on it.\n  - When unsure, leave it. A stale team memory costs little; deleting a teammate's load-bearing note costs a lot.\n\nDo not promote personal memories into `team/` during a dream \u2014 that's a deliberate choice the user makes via `/remember`, not something to do reflexively.",yGp=`### Reconcile memories against CLAUDE.md

Project CLAUDE.md instructions are loaded in your system prompt. For each \`feedback\` or \`project\` memory, check whether it contradicts a CLAUDE.md instruction on the same topic:

- **Memory is stale** \u2014 CLAUDE.md and the memory describe different procedures for the same task: CLAUDE.md is the maintained, checked-in source. Delete the memory, or rewrite it to agree if it carries context worth keeping (the *why* is still useful but the *how* is wrong).
- **CLAUDE.md may be stale** \u2014 the memory is clearly dated after CLAUDE.md and explicitly corrects it: do NOT edit CLAUDE.md during a dream. Annotate the memory with "contradicts CLAUDE.md \u2014 verify which is current" and list it in your summary so the user can update CLAUDE.md.
- **Not a conflict** \u2014 the memory adds detail CLAUDE.md doesn't cover, or narrows a CLAUDE.md rule with a stated reason. Leave it.

A \`feedback\` memory's "Why: the user corrected me" framing is not evidence it's newer than CLAUDE.md \u2014 CLAUDE.md may have been updated since.`;
