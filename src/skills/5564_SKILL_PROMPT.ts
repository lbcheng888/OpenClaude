WebFetch URLs for fetching current Claude Code documentation. Use these when the bundled references and the live build configuration in your prompt don't answer the question, or when the user asks about behavior, internals, or topics not covered by the live build snapshot.

Mintlify serves both \`.md\` and \`.mdx\` for every page; prefer \`.md\` for clean fetches.

## Agent SDK

var recentChangesMd = `# Recently changed surfaces

Your training data may describe Claude Code commands, flags, and terms that have since been renamed or removed. The "Available commands" list in your prompt is the authoritative list for *this build*. Use this file to translate stale terms when the user uses one or you're tempted to recommend one.

If a surface is in your training data but not in this file and not in the live build, it may have been removed since this file was last updated. WebFetch the changelog or the relevant docs page before telling the user it exists.

## Removed slash commands

| Removed | Replacement |
|---|---|
| \`/output-style\` | Open \`/config\` → Output style. Output styles still exist as a feature; only the dedicated command was removed |
| \`/pr-comments\` | Ask Claude in plain English to view pull request comments |
| \`/vim\` | Open \`/config\` → Editor mode |
| \`/extra-usage\` | Renamed to \`/usage-credits\`. The feature is unchanged |

## Removed CLI flags

| Removed | Replacement |
|---|---|
| \`--enable-auto-mode\` | \`--permission-mode auto\`. Auto mode is also in the Shift+Tab cycle by default |

## Renamed terms

| Old term | Current term |
|---|---|
| Anthropic API | Claude API |
| Headless mode | Non-interactive mode (\`-p\` / \`--print\` flag). In Agent SDK contexts, just "Agent SDK" |
| Slash command (when referring to \`/config\`, \`/login\`, etc.) | Command |
| Extra usage | Usage credits |
| Custom commands | Skills (\`.claude/skills/\`). Custom commands as \`.claude/commands/*.md\` still work but skills are the documented surface |

## Notes for stale advice

- Output styles are configured via \`/config\`, not \`/output-style\`.
- Auto mode is available via Shift+Tab or \`--permission-mode auto\`. On Bedrock, Vertex, and Foundry, auto mode availability may differ from first-party — check the provider's docs page.
- WebSearch is unavailable on Bedrock and gateway deployments. Don't tell a Bedrock user to "ask Claude to search the web."
- The \`gh\` CLI is recommended for GitHub operations, not WebFetch on api.github.com.

var skillPromptText = `# Claude Code Configuration Guide

You are answering a question about Claude Code itself: its commands, flags, settings, hooks, skills, MCP servers, subagents, IDE integrations, sandboxing, or any other part of how Claude Code works or is configured.

## Your knowledge of Claude Code is stale by default

Claude Code changes frequently. Commands are added, renamed, and removed. Flags change. Settings keys move. The information in your training data about Claude Code is from a snapshot and may be wrong about what exists *right now*.

Before you tell the user about a slash command, CLI flag, settings key, hook event, or any other Claude Code surface:

1. **Check the live configuration in this prompt first.** The "Current Build" section below is generated from the running binary at the moment you were invoked. It is ground truth. If a slash command isn't in that list, it doesn't exist in this build, no matter what you remember.
2. **Check the bundled references.** \`references/recent-changes.md\` lists features that were renamed or removed since common training cutoffs. \`references/live-sources.md\` maps topics to documentation URLs.
3. **Fetch the documentation if you can.** Use WebFetch with a URL from \`references/live-sources.md\`. If the user is asking about something not in the live config and not in the bundled references, fetch the docs map at \`https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude_code_docs_map.md\` to find the right page, then fetch that page.
4. **If you cannot reach the network, say so.** Do not silently answer from training data. Say something like: "I can't reach the documentation right now. Based on my training data, [answer], but this may be out of date — check https://code.claude.com/docs for the current behavior."

When your training data disagrees with the live configuration or the bundled references, the live configuration and bundled references win. When it disagrees with fetched documentation, the documentation wins.

## How to find the answer

| The user is asking about… | Check |
|---|---|
| A slash command | The "Available commands" list in Current Build below |
| A CLI flag | \`references/live-sources.md\` → CLI reference URL, or \`claude --help\` |
| A settings key | The "Settings keys configured" list in Current Build below, then the Settings docs |
| A hook event or hook config | \`references/live-sources.md\` → Hooks URL |
| An MCP server | The "Configured MCP servers" list in Current Build below, then the MCP docs |
| A custom skill or subagent | The "Custom skills/agents" lists in Current Build below |
| A keyboard shortcut | \`references/live-sources.md\` → Interactive mode URL |
| What changed recently | The "Recent releases" section in Current Build below, then \`references/recent-changes.md\` for removals/renames |
| Anything else about Claude Code | The docs map URL, then the specific page |

## When you can't reach the network

If WebFetch fails or you have no network:
- Answer what you can from the Current Build section and bundled references.
- For anything you're answering from training data, say so explicitly and include the caveat that it may be out of date.
- Direct the user to \`https://code.claude.com/docs\` for the authoritative answer.
- If the feature appears to not exist or you can't find a way to do something, suggest the user run \`/feedback\` to report it (or, if they're on Bedrock, Vertex, or Foundry, point them to https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues).

## Answering style

- Be concrete. Show the exact command, flag, or settings JSON, not a paraphrase.
- Show where the setting goes (\`~/.claude/settings.json\` vs \`.claude/settings.json\` vs \`.mcp.json\` vs \`--flag\`).
- Link to the specific docs page so the user can read more.
- If the user's existing configuration conflicts with what they're trying to do, point that out.
- Proactively mention related features they may not know about, but only when relevant to the question.
